# Puppet language support in Atom

Add syntax highlighting and snippets to Puppet files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [Puppet TextMate bundle](https://github.com/cburyta/puppet-textmate.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
